The CA assignment for end of course in CSS Frameworks.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This si the CA assingnment for the end of the course in CSS Frameworks. We were given the assignment to design and develop a social media site with three pages, home, profile and log in. The project should include a log in form, a publish post, a searh bar and on the profile site also contain list of friends and posts.

The site is made with HTML, CSS, Javascript, CSS Bootstrap and Sass.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>I started the project doing the design in Adobe XD. I wanted to make some kind of workout site inspired by a workout app I am using called Fiton. The target audience of mye site is mainly females in their 20s, 30s and 40s that are interested in working out and sports and a healthy lifestyle.
 I wanted it to be a social media app with a focus on photography, sharing and inspiring, and I wanted an appealing and calm visual design.
